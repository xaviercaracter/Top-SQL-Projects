# **Overview**
This repo contains my best work using SQL at Boise State University.

- School Management System/Class Registry
  - Using MySQL, I designed a mock school management system, where CRUD operations for students, teachers, and faculty are supported.
- Gene Bank Search Database
  - Using SQLite, I added the results of a gene bank search to a database and generated query results for spreadsheet manipulation.
- School Gradebook System/Class Registry
  - Using Java, my partner and I created a command-line application for managing classes and grades utilizing a SQL database.
